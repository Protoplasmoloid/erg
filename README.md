# erg
A simple PM2+ protocol reader, intended just as an exercise/reminder for myself (as a now retired engineer) in serial data communication.  I was intending to make data available as csv, but due to insufficiant insight as to how the protocol and formulas work, I'll just leave it as a working interface that only gets distance, pace and time data (as specified in an old PDF I found on the C2 forum). 

Disclaimer
This is, as stated above, a test for serial comms and protocol extraction from the PM2+ device, which I happen to have ATM. I will not be liable for any physical or mental injury sustained when operating the ERG (in this case a Concept2 rower) during testing, as the PM2+ module is considered to be a seperate entity to the rowing machine hardware itself.
