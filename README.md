# erg
A simple PM2+ protocol reader, intended as an exercise/reminder for myself, as a now retired engineer, in serial data communication.  I intend to make data available for import to spreadsheets (csv),  MAYBE later other visualisation tools such as Graphana via database back ends such as RabbitMQ. 

Disclaimer
This is, as stated above, a test for serial comms and protocol extraction from the PM2+ device, which I happen to have ATM. I will not be liable for any physical or mental injury sustained when operating the ERG (in this case a Concept2 rower) during testing, as the PM2+ module is considered to be a seperate entity to the rowing machine hardware itself.
